### Hello ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for using Annotate Design! If you have any feature requests, or improvement ideas, or if you encountered any bugs, I'd love to hear from you.

I built this plugin as a learning project and to speed up my design workflows. I hope it's useful for you too if you're using it.

Right now the code is quite messy but I am improving it while going forward and learning more stuff.

Give the plugin a try: https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1190992260300542362/annotate-design
